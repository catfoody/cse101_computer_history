Memory & Storage

Introduction:

    Electronic computer memory and storage was first created in the 1940’s using the Manchester Mark I Williams-Kilburn tube. This creation drastically revolutionized the usage of computers by speeding up data storage and recovery. Over the past 70 years computer memory and storage have evolved greatly. Now we have the ability to create a whole computer the size of a rice grain, but still have plenty of memory and storage. The most modern forms of memory and storage use processors that can have up to 3 TB of RAM and 48 TB of storage. This was achieved on the HP Z8 PC. This report will go over the history of how we have achieved specifications like these.

Time Period:

    During the 1940’s we had a great need to revolutionize America’s computer world. This was due to World War 2. Our main concern was used during the Manhattan Project. Scientists had to make several long calculations that would take ages to do by hand, but minutes or even seconds to do on a computer. Our first creation was the Manchester Mark I Williams-Kilburn tube. This was used in the MANIAC computer at Los Alamos National Labs. This revolutionized work on the Manhattan Project and helped us complete it in record time in order to end the war. The discovery of computerized memory and storage lead to other creations, such as magnetic drum memory and magnetic core memory. All these creations kept leading to new discoveries therefore revolutionizing the computer world.

Hardware:

	The history of hardware in relation to memory and storage has changed dramatically over time, and modern day technology. In the early 1940's, at Manchester University both Freddie Williams and Tom Kilburn develop the WIlliams-Kilburn tube. This tube was the first high-speed, entirely electronic memory. Fast forward to 1950 and the US Navy contracts with the Engineering REsearch Associates and they construct the Atlas, which used magnetic drum memory, which stored information on the outside of a rotating cylinder coataed with gerromagnetic material.In 1962, at the University of Manchester  a team under the direction of Tom Kilburn starts to work on a concept of virtual memory for its Atlas Computer. Virtual memory permitted their Atlas computer to use its storage capacity to switch rapidly from multiple programs or even users. In 1966 we see 8-bit ram which is one of the earlier uses of dedicated semiconductor memorry in computer systems.Signetics 8-bit RAM was designed for the SDS Sigma 7 mainframe computer, and shows us an early use of dedicated memory. Around the 1980's Seagate Technology creates the first hard disk drive for microcomputers, after this Seagate grew into a powerful storage and memory company. In our opinion 2009 marks a crucial point in storage hardware history because Hitachi Global Storage Technologies announces the first One Terabyte Hard disk drive.
	
Software: 

The history of software in relation to memory and storage can be very confusing, because there is no fine line stating when software was introduced into the hardware aspect of memory and storage. However drivers are a common software that is necessary for the full use of your memory or storage.
